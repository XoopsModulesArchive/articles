Upgrading to v0.25

There is an optional database update script (update025.php) for this release, 
it allows for articles larger than 16kb, where large articles can get truncated 
after being submitted. Otherwise, it's a case of upload and overwriting files as
normal.


Upgrading to v0.24
==================

If you are upgrading from a version prior to v0.22, follow instructions as 
for v0.22, below.
If upgrading from v0.22, upload new files, and over-write, then upgrade module
in the system->modules admin as usual.


Upgrading to v0.23
==================

If you are upgrading from a version prior to v0.22, follow instructions as 
for v0.22, below.
If upgrading from v0.22, upload new files, and over-write, then upgrade module
in the system->modules admin as usual.


Upgrading to v0.22
==================

.:IMPORTANT:.
This release requires a database update, please run "update021.php" after the 
module has been updated in XOOPS.

Unarchive the Articles package and upload the "articles" folder and its contents
to the modules folder in your web site, over-writing any existing files. Some of 
the admin files have been moved/renamed/deleted, as a result, you may  want to 
delete the existing admin folder before uploading the new files. This is not 
totally necessary, but will save you  some web space.

Go to the system admin, modules admin and update Articles. Finally, load the 
update file, e.g., http://yourxoopssite.com/modules/articles/update021.php to 
update the database.

Because of certain code changes, some articles may not display properly - this 
just requires that you reset the display options for these.


Versions 0.19 - 0.21 not publically released.
===============================================


Upgrading to v0.17
==================

Follow instructions as per v0.16 below.


Upgrading to v0.16
==================

If you are upgrading from v0.12, simply upload and over-write any existing 
Articles files in your web space, then click the update icon for articles in
the modules admin.

There are no database changes for this version, so there is no update script
to apply, unless you are upgrading from a version earlier than v0.12.  If this 
is the case, then follow the v0.12 upgrade instructions below.


Versions 0.13, 0.14 and 0.15 not publically released.
=============================================== 


Upgrading to v0.12
==================

.:IMPORTANT:.
This version requires a database upgrade, without this, Articles will not work
as expected! If you are installing Articles from scratch, the database upgrade 
is not needed.

Upload and over-write the existing Article module files, update it as usual in
the admin panel, then go to:

http://www.yoursitewhatever.com/modules/articles/update012.php

This is a script I have written to save you the tedious task of copying all of
your article data, uninstalling Articles v0.09 (or lower), re-installing v0.12
and then re-entering all of your articles again.

Follow the prompts and all the hard work is done for you. Articles v0.12 should
then be updated fully.

You do have an option to backup the database table that is modified, so *if* 
anything should go wrong during the update, you can use something like 
phpMyAdmin (http://www.phpmyadmin.net - or try the Xoops module of phpMyAdmin)
to copy it back again. The backup table is called 
"{prefix}_articles_main_pre012" ("{prefix}" is the prefix given to all Xoops 
tables, you were asked for this when Xoops was installed and is usually kept 
as "xoops").
